- My name is Abhijeet Kumar.
- I am currently pursuing a B.Tech degree from CUSAT (Cochin University of Science and Technology) in the field of Information Technology.
- I have knowledge of several programming languages and web technologies, including C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and Python.
- currently studying Java.
- I've already developed some interesting projects, including:
    A calculator that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to perform various arithmetic operations.
    "Medarch," a hospital record management system project. This sounds like a significant project that likely involves database management, user interfaces, and potentially some backend programming.
